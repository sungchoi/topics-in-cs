p use i for the first character     use n for the first character    use k for the first character

i use i for the second character    use n for the second character   use k for the first character

n use i for the third character     use n for the third character    use k for the third character

t use i for the fourth character    use n for the fourth character

(keep the letters following the letter used)


Each time we move to the right, we remove a letter. Right is removal
Down is an addition
Right plus down is equal to a single diagonal move is a replacement or do nothing

subtract one for do nothing moves


each block is equal to its neighbors.min + 1 unless the row and col are the same letter (i.e. + 0 for no change)
